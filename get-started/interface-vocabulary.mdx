## Overview

Vocabulary is a specialized AI feature in Superwhisper that helps improve transcription accuracy by providing custom word recognition during the AI transcription process.

---
## How it Works
When you add words to the Vocabulary tab, you're essentially providing the AI transcription model with:
- Custom words
- Acronyms
- Company names
- Specialized terminology

These words are sent alongside the audio to help the AI recognize and accurately transcribe specific terms.

---
## Important Considerations

While the Vocabulary feature can be helpful, it should be used sparingly to avoid potential transcription complications.
- Adding too many words can confuse the AI transcription model
- Words in different languages might impact transcription accuracy
- The feature influences not just spelling, but potentially:
  - Punctuation
  - Automatic language detection
  - Overall formatting

<Tip>
**Recommended approach:** Use Vocabulary minimally and complement it with the [Replacements](interface-replacements) feature for more consistent results.
