## Overview

The Vocabulary feature in Superwhisper provides two powerful tools to improve your dictation experience: vocabulary words for better AI transcription recognition, and replacements for consistent post-transcription corrections.

## Vocabulary Words

### How Vocabulary Words Work

When you add words to the vocabulary section, you're providing the AI transcription model with custom recognition hints during the transcription process. These words are sent alongside your audio to help the AI recognize and accurately transcribe:

- Custom words
- Acronyms  
- Company names
- People's names
- Specialized terminology
- Words from other languages

### Important Considerations for Vocabulary

While the vocabulary feature can be helpful, it should be used sparingly to avoid potential transcription complications:

- Adding too many words can confuse the AI transcription model
- Words in different languages might impact transcription accuracy
- The feature influences not just spelling, but potentially:
  - Punctuation
  - Automatic language detection
  - Overall formatting

<Tip>
**Recommended approach:** Use vocabulary words minimally and complement them with replacements for more consistent results.

## Replacements

### How Replacements Work

Replacements operate at the post-transcription stage of processing. Once your voice input is transcribed into text, any replacements you've configured will be automatically applied. This step is performed programmatically and does not rely on AI interpretation, ensuring that replacements happen exactly as you define them.

<Info>
Replacements match words regardless of capitalization. The matching system is case-insensitive, so "todo" will match "ToDo", "TODO", or "Todo". The replaced output will appear in the exact case you have specified for the replacement.
</Info>

### When to Use Replacements

Replacements are the recommended solution for correcting persistent errors or expanding frequently used phrases. Because this feature operates independently of AI, the results are consistent and immediate, regardless of how the transcription model performs.

<Check>
If you notice that certain words are consistently mis-transcribed, you can add multiple replacements to address every variation and point them all to the correct result.
