 There are two ways to open settings.
 
 <Steps>
    <Step title="Open via the toolbar.">
        Up in your toolbar near the wifi symbol, there should be a Superwhisper Logo.
        
        When you click on it, a list of options should appear. 
        
        Go down to settings and click to open. Just like that, settings should be open!
        
        <video
        style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
        src="/videos/get-started/settings-1.mp4"
        controls
        width="100%"
        height="auto"
        />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Open it via keybind">
         When you have the SuperWhisper dictation window open, click on the window to engage it and press the âŒ˜ and , keys to open settings.
