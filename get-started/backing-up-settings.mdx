## Overview

Backing up your Superwhisper settings provides several benefits:

- **Device Migration**: Transfer your setup when upgrading to a new computer
- **Multi-Device Usage**: Maintain consistent experience across multiple devices
- **Data Protection**: Safeguard against accidental deletion or system failures
- **Configuration Sharing**: Share specialized dictation setups with colleagues
- **Version Control**: Keep snapshots of your configuration at different stages

## Configuration Location

By default, Superwhisper saves all configuration files in the **~/Documents/Superwhisper** folder on your system. If you prefer to store your Superwhisper files in a different location, you can do so from within the Advanced settings in the Configuration tab.

This folder contains several important subdirectories:

- **Models**: Contains configuration files of custom models you've added
- **Modes**: Stores all modes you've created or customized
- **Settings**: Includes vocabulary lists and text replacements
- **Recordings**: Contains your dictation history files
