**Superwhisper is designed to work excellently right out of the box, so if you've completed the initial onboarding, you're already set to start dictating.** While the default configuration suits most users perfectly, one of Superwhisper's greatest strengths is its customization potential.

Superwhisper offers a wide range of customization options to help you create the perfect dictation environment. From basic audio settings to advanced configuration options, you can tailor the application to match your specific needs and workflow preferences.
