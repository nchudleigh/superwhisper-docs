## Overview

Superwhisper's AI-powered dictation makes the process simple, but you might need to explore your recordings in detail. The History is packed with features that allow you to filter through past dictations, reprocess recordings with different modes, and access detailed information about both voice and AI processing.

<Note>Keep in mind: Search only filters original dictation, not AI-processed results</Note>

---
### Reprocess Recordings
Sometimes your dictation results may not meet your expectations. Various factors can affect the outcome - from voice models to AI processing or system-related issues. You can reprocess any dictation when needed. Just remember that Superwhisper will use your currently active mode for the new processing.

To reprocess a dictation, right-click it in the left sidebar and select "Process Again."

</Steps>

<Note>Superwhisper does not automatically delete past recordings. It's recommended to periodically clean up your history manually to manage storage space.</Note>

### Analyze Results
Superwhisper's History can display your voice transcription and AI-processed text. Two sets of controls let you switch between these views: one in the top-right side of the window and another below the waveform display. Each set includes buttons to toggle between "Voice" (the original transcription) and "AI" (the processed result), plus a "Copy" button that copies the currently displayed text.

<Note>Note that AI processing depends on your selected mode, so some recordings may only have voice transcription available.</Note>

### Speaker Separation

In Superwhisper's History, you can access speaker-separated transcriptions through the Segments view. This view appears alongside the buttons that toggle between voice and AI results.

<Note>
Currently, Nova Cloud provides the most accurate speaker differentiation among Superwhisper's voice models. For detailed information on how to process speaker-separated transcriptions with AI, refer to [this guide](../modes/speaker-separated-meetings).
</Note>

When in Segments view, you can rename speakers in two ways:
- Click the speaker name directly in the transcription
- Select speakers from the right sidebar

Consider renaming your speakers before using the copy button - it will transfer your formatted transcript with the updated speaker names to your clipboard.
