## Overview
Superwhisper's recording window is carefully designed to provide intuitive control and real-time feedback during your dictation. 

**Let's explore the key components of the main recording interface:**

---
## Main Recording Window
### 1. Resize Toggle

alt="Superwhisper Resize Toggle"
/>
When you hover over the recording window, you can click here to switch between the main and mini view.

### 2. Audio Waveform

alt="Superwhisper Audio Waveform"
/>

The waveform visually represents the audio captured by your microphone, giving you real-time feedback during dictation sessions. A moving waveform indicates your microphone captures audio correctly.

If the waveform stays static, check these elements:
- Verify your selected audio input device in [Superwhisper's Sound tab](settings-sound)
- Confirm microphone permissions in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone

<Note>Exception: When using [system audio capture in a Custom mode](../modes/custom#audio-options), the waveform remains static. Your audio still records properly - you can verify this in the [History tab](interface-history), which displays detailed information about each dictation session.</Note>

### 3. Status Indicator

alt="Superwhisper Status Indicator"
/>

The color-coded dot reflects the current recording status, similar to the one in [the menu bar](interface-menu-bar#status-indicator-dot):
- Yellow: Model loading in progress
- Blue: Dictation processing
- Green: Processing completed

### 4. Mode Display 

<img

alt="Superwhisper Mode Display"
/>

This area of the recording window shows your currently active mode in Superwhisper and displays the keyboard shortcut for quick mode switching. You can click here to switch modes manually.

<Info>
In Super Mode, this area displays your current application or website context.
</Info>

### 5. Context Capture

<img
style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}
src="/images/get-started/interface-rec-window-007.png"
alt="Superwhisper Context Capture Indicator"
/>

This indicator can appear in Super Mode or Custom modes with [context awareness features](../common-issues/context) enabled. It lights up to confirm Superwhisper has captured clipboard context - when you copy text within 3 seconds before dictation starts or during an active dictation session. Additionally, it signals when selected text context is captured at the exact moment recording begins.

### 6. Stop Recording

<img
style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}
src="/images/get-started/interface-rec-window-008.png"
alt="Stop Superwhisper's dictation"
/>

If you're ready to wrap up your dictation, click here to stop recording - or use the same keyboard shortcut you used to start.

### 7. Cancel Dictation

<img
style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}
src="/images/get-started/interface-rec-window-009.png"
alt="Cancel Superwhisper's dictation"
/>

Click here to cancel your current dictation session or use your assigned keyboard shortcut. For recordings longer than 30 seconds, Superwhisper displays a confirmation message to prevent accidental cancellations. Recordings under 30 seconds cancel immediately.

## Mini Recording Window

The mini recording window provides a compact yet feature-rich interface for controlling Superwhisper.

### Always-Active Mini Window

[In Advanced Settings](settings-advanced#recording-window), you can configure the mini window to remain active even when idle. This creates a small visual indicator that's always accessible.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Hover Over the Indicator">
    When you hover over the mini window indicator, a control panel appears with three options:
  1.  Change Mode
  2.  Start Recording
  3.  Expand to Regular Window

alt="Superwhisper Mini Window on Hover"
/>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Post-Request Controls">
    These same controls (Change Mode, Start Recording, Expand) also appear after a dictation request completes, particularly when results aren't automatically pasted to the front application.

/>

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Recording with the Mini Window
You can start recording either by:
- Clicking the recording button in the mini window
- Using your standard keyboard shortcut

During recording, the mini window displays audio waveforms similar to the main window (1). When you hover over the mini window while recording (2), a stop button appears to end the recording and begin processing.

### Additional Mini Window Features

<Tip>
Right-click on the mini window to access a context menu with options to:
- Expand Window
- Open Settings
- Open History

These options are also available during active recording sessions.
