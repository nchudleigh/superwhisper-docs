## Overview
Superwhisper's recording window is carefully designed to provide intuitive control and real-time feedback during your dictation. 

**Let's explore the seven essential components of this powerful interface:**

---
## 1. Resize Toggle

alt="Superwhisper Resize Toggle"
/>
When you hover over the recording window, you can click here to switch between a large and mini view.

<Accordion title="Mini View" icon="microphone-lines" defaultOpen="true">
The mini view simplifies your recording experience by displaying only essential features like the waveform and status indicator. This compact interface lets you focus on dictation without distractions.

## 2. Audio Waveform

alt="Superwhisper Audio Waveform"
/>

The waveform visually represents the audio captured by your microphone, giving you real-time feedback during dictation sessions. A moving waveform indicates your microphone captures audio correctly.

If the waveform stays static, check these elements:
- Verify your selected audio input device in [Superwhisper's Sound tab](settings-sound)
- Confirm microphone permissions in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone

<Note>Exception: When using [system audio capture in a Custom mode](../modes/custom#audio-options), the waveform remains static. Your audio still records properly - you can verify this in the [History tab](interface-history), which displays detailed information about each dictation session.</Note>

## 3. Status Indicator

alt="Superwhisper Status Indicator"
/>

The color-coded dot reflects the current recording status, similar to the one in [the menu bar](interface-menu-bar#status-indicator-dot):
- Yellow: Model loading in progress
- Blue: Dictation processing
- Green: Processing completed

## 4. Mode Display 

<img
style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}
src="/images/get-started/interface-rec-window-006.png"
alt="Superwhisper Mode Display"
/>

This area of the recording window shows your currently active mode in Superwhisper and displays the keyboard shortcut for quick mode switching. You can click here to switch modes manually.

<Info>
In Super Mode, this area displays your current application or website context.

## 5. Context Capture

<img
style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}
src="/images/get-started/interface-rec-window-007.png"
alt="Superwhisper Context Capture Indicator"
/>

This indicator can appear in Super Mode or Custom modes with context awareness features enabled. It lights up to confirm Superwhisper has captured clipboard context - either when you copy text within 3 seconds before dictation starts or during an active dictation session.

---
## 6. Stop Recording

<img
style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}
src="/images/get-started/interface-rec-window-008.png"
alt="Stop Superwhisper's dictation"
/>

If you're ready to wrap up your dictation, click here to stop recording - or use the same keyboard shortcut you used to start.

---
## 7. Cancel Dictation

<img
style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}
src="/images/get-started/interface-rec-window-009.png"
alt="Cancel Superwhisper's dictation"
/>

Click here to cancel your current dictation session or use your assigned keyboard shortcut. For recordings longer than 30 seconds, Superwhisper displays a confirmation message to prevent accidental cancellations. Recordings under 30 seconds cancel immediately.
