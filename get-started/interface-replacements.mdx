## Overview

Superwhisper's replacements operate at the post-transcription stage of processing. Once your voice input is transcribed into text, any replacements youâ€™ve configured will be automatically applied. This step is performed programmatically and does not rely on AI interpretation, ensuring that replacements happen exactly as you define them.

<Info>
Replacements match words regardless of capitalization. The matching system is case-insensitive, so "todo" will match "ToDo", "TODO", or "Todo". The replaced output will appear in the exact case you have specified for the replacement.

## When to Use

Replacements are the recommended solution for correcting persistent errors or expanding frequently used phrases. Because this feature operates independently of AI, the results are consistent and immediate, regardless of how the transcription model performs.
