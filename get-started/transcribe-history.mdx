## Why Transcribe from History?

Transcribing from history offers several advantages.

If a file fails to transcribe or the app crashes, you can still use the recording to generate your text output.

Additionally, you might want to transcribe from history if you wish to adjust the mode settings or switch to an entirely different mode.


## How to Transcribe from History

Open the app settings window, and click the History tab on the left.

In History, right-click on any recording you want to re-transcribe and select "Process again."

If you want to try something different with your audio recording, you can use a different mode.

## How to Transcribe a File

To transcribe an audio file from your computer, first go to your toolbar and click "Transcribe file..."

This icon can be found next to your wifi and time in the top right of your Mac.

This will open a window where you can select your audio file.
