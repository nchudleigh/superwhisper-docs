## Overview

Superwhisper's context awareness is one of its most powerful features, allowing the application to process your dictation with relevant information. This creates more accurate results.

---
### Types of Context

Superwhisper can capture three different types of context:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Selected Text Context" icon="text-size">
    Text that is highlighted/selected in your active window when you begin recording.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Application Context" icon="window">
    Text from active input fields, names, and title from your active window.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Clipboard Context" icon="clipboard">
    Content that has been copied to your clipboard before or during dictation.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

---
### Context Availability

Not all modes in Superwhisper capture context by default. Understanding which modes use context is essential for getting the results you expect.

- **Built-in Modes**: Most do not have context awareness enabled
- **Super Mode**: The only built-in mode with all three context types enabled by default
- **Custom Modes**: Can be configured to use any combination of context types

<Tip>
Be selective about which context types you enable for custom modes. Enabling unnecessary context can send excessive information to the AI, potentially affecting result quality.
</Tip>

### Context Capture Timing

Each type of context is captured at a different point in the dictation process, which is important to understand for optimal results:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Selected Text Context">
    Captured exactly when you start recording (when you toggle on dictation). The focus must remain on the application containing the selected text at this moment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clipboard Context">
    Captured either within three seconds before recording starts OR during dictation. The last item copied during this period will be used.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Application Context">
    Captured after voice processing is complete, between the transcription and AI processing steps. This means your active window at this point determines what context is captured.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Context Issues and Solutions

### Selected Text Context Not Working
- **Focus Issue**: Make sure your focus is on the application with the selected text when you start recording
- **Mode Configuration**: Verify you're using Super Mode or a custom mode with [selected text context enabled](../modes/custom#advanced-tip)
- **Deep Link Usage**: When triggering recording via deep links using shell commands, use the `-g` flag to open in the background so focus remains on your target application

---
### Application Context Not Working
- **Switching Windows**: If you switch to a different window after dictation but before processing completes, you may capture the wrong context or none at all
- **Accessibility Permissions**: Ensure Superwhisper has accessibility permissions enabled in System Preferences/Settings
- **Mode Configuration**: Verify the mode you're using has application context enabled

---
### Clipboard Context Not Working
- **Timing Issues**: Make sure you're copying content either shortly (three seconds) before starting recording or during dictation
- **Mode Configuration**: Verify the mode you're using has clipboard context enabled
