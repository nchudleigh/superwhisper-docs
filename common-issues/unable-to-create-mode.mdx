## Overview
When you enable iCloud Documents syncing on your Mac, the Superwhisper folder may automatically move to iCloud. However, the application might still reference its original location. This mismatch prevents Superwhisper from creating new modes and can cause other functionality issues.

## Step-by-Step Process
Follow these steps to redirect Superwhisper to the correct folder location:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Configuration Tab">
    Access the Configuration section from the left sidebar menu in Superwhisper and go to "Advanced Settings."

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Change Folder Location">
    Scroll down to find the "Change Folder" option and click it.
      <img style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} src="/images/common-issues/unable-to-create-mode-002.png" alt="Superwhisper Folder Location" />
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Documents Folder">
    In the file browser that appears, navigate to your Documents folder and click "Open".
      <img style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} src="/images/common-issues/unable-to-create-mode-003.png" alt="Navigating to Documents Folder" />
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm the Change">
    Click "Confirm" in the dialog box to apply the folder location change.
   <img style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} src="/images/common-issues/unable-to-create-mode-004.png" alt="Confirmation dialog for folder change" />
  </Step>
</Steps>

After completing these steps, Superwhisper will correctly reference your Documents folder, allowing you to create new modes and use all features as expected.
