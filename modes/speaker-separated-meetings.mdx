description: "Learn how to transcribe meetings with speaker separation and process them with AI for enhanced insights. This method combines Superwhisper's speaker identification capabilities with powerful AI processing."

<Note>
This is an advanced workflow requiring configuration file edits and multiple steps. If you need basic meeting summaries, consider using the standard Meeting Mode.  Or, if you want speaker-separated transcripts with basic AI processing, simply enable speaker separation in a Custom Mode with Nova (Cloud) for voice.
</Note>

## Overview
This guide shows you how to combine speaker-separated transcription with AI analysis to understand each participant's contributions in your meetings. You'll learn how to capture detailed transcripts that track who said what, then use AI to extract meaningful insights from individual speakers' input.

## Transcription Setup and Recording
<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Speaker Separation Mode">
Create a new Custom Mode with these settings:
- Enable "Identify Speakers" toggle
- Enable "Record from System Audio" if recording live meetings
- Select your preferred voice model

<Tip>While all voice models support speaker separation, Nova (Cloud) delivers the most accurate and reliable results for this feature.</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Disable AI Processing">
Disable AI processing initially to speed up transcription. This approach is suggested since Superwhisper currently can't process speaker-separated transcripts with AI in the same mode. Remember to back up your mode's config file before making changes:
- Navigate to: ~/Documents/superwhisper/modes/
- Open your mode's JSON file in your preferred text editor
- Change "languageModelEnabled" from `true` to `false`
- Save and restart Superwhisper for changes to take effect
</Step>

<Step title="Capture & Transcribe Your Meeting">
Choose your preferred recording method:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Live Recording">
- Select your speaker separation mode
- Start recording
<Note>Be aware that pressing Escape will stop recording</Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Process Existing Audio">
- Record meeting with your preferred app
- Click the Superwhisper menu bar icon
- Select your speaker separation mode
- Select "Transcribe File"
- Choose your audio file
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
</Step>
