</Note>

## Overview
In this guide, there's two key areas of focus. First, you'll learn how to capture accurate transcripts that identify and separate different speakers in your meetings. Then, we'll explore how to enhance these transcripts through AI processing, which can help you extract summaries, action items, or other valuable insights.

## Step-by-Step
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="1. Create a Speaker Separation Mode">
<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Custom Mode">
Start by creating a new Custom Mode with these essential settings:
- Enable "Identify Speakers" toggle
- Enable "Record from System Audio" if recording live meetings
- Select your preferred voice model

<Tip>While all voice models support speaker separation, Nova (Cloud) delivers the most accurate and reliable results for this feature.</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Disable AI Processing">
Disable AI processing initially to speed up transcription. This approach is suggest since Superwhisper currently can't process speaker-separated transcripts with AI in the same mode. Remember to back up your mode's config file before making changes
1. Navigate to: ~/Documents/SuperWhisper/modes/
2. Open your mode's JSON file in your preferred text editor
3. Change "languageModelEnabled" from `true` to `false`
4. Save and restart Superwhisper for changes to take effect
