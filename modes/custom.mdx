## Key Features
**Custom Mode empowers you with:**
- Complete control over AI processing instructions
- Context-awareness capabilities
- Advanced audio capture options
- Flexible processing for any workflow

## Additional Settings
### AI Instructions
Beyond selecting your preferred AI model, with Custom Mode you have the option to personalize your own AI processing instructions.

/>

<Note>Instructions are empty by default. Select "Change Prompt" to modify them. If left blank, AI will not know what task to perform and may give unexpected results. </Note>

### Audio Options

- **Record from System Audio:** 
  - Perfect for meetings, video content, interviews, or live audio coming your speakers
  - When recording system audio, the waves on the recording window do not move. You can always check Superwhisper's history to verify capture
- **Identify Speakers**
  - Useful for meeting transcriptions
  - Speaker separation results appear in the Segments tab of History

<Note>Speaker-separated transcripts won't process through AI automatically within the same mode. See [this guide](speaker-separated-meetings) on handling multi-speaker transcripts with AI processing.</Note>

### Context Awareness

Inside the Change Prompt section, you'll discover two powerful features:
- Use application context toggle
- Use copied text toggle

<Note>These toggles work identically to [Super Mode context awareness features](super#context-awareness).</Note>

## Prompting Tips
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Referencing Content">
**When writing AI instructions for use in Superwhisper, you can direct AI's attention to specific content using these XML-style tags:**

- `<user_message>`
  - Contains your dictated text
- `<application_context>`
  - Includes the data from your active application window
- `<clipboard_context>`
  - Contains the text you've copied

---

T**hese tags let you create targeted instructions for AI**. For example:
- "Translate `<user_message>` to Spanish"
- "Based on `<application_context>`, suggest relevant code comments"
- "Format `<user_message>` accordingly based on the content found in `<clipboard_context>`"

<Tip>If you want AI to know your input is dictated speech, include it explicitly. For example: *"The `<user_message>` contains dictated text. Please format it into proper paragraphs."*</Tip>

---

**Instruct AI exactly which content to focus on and what to do with it.** You can combine them in your instructions to create powerful workflows:
```
If <application_context> shows a code editor:
- Format <user_message> as code comments
- Use coding style from <clipboard_context> as reference
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Writing Effective Instructions">
<Steps>

<Step title="Clear Purpose">
Define your AI instructions by starting with a clear role or purpose statement. This sets the foundation for how the AI will process your content.
</Step>

<Step title="Requirements">
Create a detailed list of specific requirements and expectations. Being explicit helps ensure the AI understands exactly what you need.
</Step>

<Step title="Structure">
Organize your instructions using separate sections for different components. This modular approach makes your instructions easier to understand and modify.
</Step>

<Step title="Keep Simple">
Write direct, straightforward instructions without unnecessary complexity. Clear communication leads to better results.
</Step>
</Steps>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Using XML Tags">
**It is suggested to structure your instructions with XML tags to communicate clearly with AI:**

**Basic Tag Structure**
- Set a role and Instructions:
```xml
<role>You are a text editor</role>
<instructions>Format the content of `<user_message>` into clear paragraphs</instructions>
```

- Define specific requirements:
```xml
<requirements>
- Use simple, clear language
- Keep the casual tone
- Break into short paragraphs
</requirements>
```

- Provide context and style:
```xml
<context>
- This content is for a cooking blog post
- Target audience is home cooks
- Should use casual, approachable language
- Include cooking-specific terminology where relevant
</context>

<style>
- Write in a warm, encouraging tone
- Use descriptive but simple language
- Include helpful cooking tips
- Make instructions easy to follow
</style>

<output-format>
- Title and introduction
- Ingredient list
- Step-by-step instructions
- Cook's notes and tips
</output-format>
```

<Note>Adjust and expand your XML tags based on your specific needs. The more detailed your instructions, the better the results.</Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Add Examples">
**Examples help you teach AI exactly how to process your input and what kind of output you expect.** Located at the bottom of the Change Prompt section, below the context toggles, you'll find the Add Examples interface.

<img
style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
src="/images/modes/modes-custom-005.png"
alt="Superwhisper interface for adding prompt examples"
/>

**Each example consists of two parts:**
- Input field: Shows how you'll phrase your requests
- Output field: Demonstrates your expected AI response

**How to set:**
- Click "Add Example" to create your first example pair
- Fill in both the input and output fields
- Add more examples by clicking "Add Example" again
- Right-click any example to duplicate or delete it

<Note>Adding 2-3 examples significantly improves AI's understanding of your needs and leads to more accurate responses.</Note>
</Accordion>

## Advanced Tip
Currently, Custom Mode doesn't include text selection context like [Super Mode](super). Enable this by editing your mode's JSON config file - just back up first and use a simple text editor like TextEdit or VS Code.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Locate Your Modes Folder" icon="circle-1">
Open Finder and navigate to ~/Documents/SuperWhisper/modes/ to access your modes folder
</Card>

<Card title="Find Your Mode File" icon="circle-2">
Use Quick Look (press Space) on JSON files to preview and identify your mode by its "name" field
</Card>

<Card title="Enable Selection Context" icon="circle-3">
Open the JSON file and change "context_from_selection" from `false` to `true`
</Card>

<Card title="Restart to Apply" icon="circle-4">
Save your changes and restart Superwhisper to activate the selection context feature
</Card>
</CardGroup>
<Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" /> *Awesome! You can now reference `<text_selection_context>` in your custom instructions, as covered in [Prompting Tips](#prompting-tips).*

---
<Tip>Unlike other modes, Custom Mode isn't limited to text formatting. **Combine context-awareness with your instructions to create powerful, specialized workflows tailored to your needs.**</Tip>
