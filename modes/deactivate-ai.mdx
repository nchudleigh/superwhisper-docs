## Overview

Custom Modes in Superwhisper provide flexibility and advanced options not available in other built-in modes. These include the ability to record from system audio and speaker separation when using Nova Cloud models.

**There are several scenarios where you might want to use Custom Mode features without AI processing:**

- You need to record and transcribe audio from applications or websites
- You want clean speaker-labeled transcripts without AI post-processing

## Step-by-Step Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Custom Mode">
    First, create a Custom Mode with the specific features you need:
    - Enable system audio capture if needed
    - Activate speaker separation if required
    - Give your mode a descriptive name
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Locate the Mode Configuration File">
    Navigate to the Superwhisper configuration folder:
    1. Open your Documents folder (or the custom location if you've modified [the setting](../get-started/settings-advanced#folder-location))
    2. Find the "Superwhisper" folder
    3. Go to the "modes" subfolder
    4. Locate the JSON file for the Custom Mode you just created
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Edit the Configuration File">
    1. Open the JSON file in any text editor
    2. Find the field labeled `languageModelEnabled`
    3. Change the value from `true` to `false`
    4. Save the file
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Restart Superwhisper">
    Close and restart the Superwhisper application for the changes to take effect.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify the Changes">
    After restarting, open your Custom Mode. You'll notice that the AI processing sections of the interface are no longer visible, confirming that AI has been deactivated for this mode.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
When AI is deactivated, you don't need to add any custom system prompts or AI instructions. The mode will function similar to a voice mode but with the advanced capabilities you've enabled.
