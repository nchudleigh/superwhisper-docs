### Deep Links
Deep links unlock powerful possibilities for mode switching—perfect for users familiar with automation tools who want to take their workflow to the next level.

**You can use the following deep links with Superwhisper:**
```
superwhisper://mode?key=YOUR_MODE_KEY
superwhisper://record
```

/>

**To find a mode's key:**
1. Navigate to ~/Documents/superwhisper/modes
2. Quick Look the mode's JSON file to fine your mode under its `name` key
3. Find the "key" value to use in your deep link

<Tip>Combine both deep links in automation tools to switch modes and start recording in one action. Here's a [sample shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fbba08e7b50b42b493a5a792af6b0a6a) to get you started.</Tip>
